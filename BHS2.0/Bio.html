<p>My name is Harshit Singh, and I am an indian national by birth. I am individual with
    strong analytical and fluent bilingual communication skills, alongside strong memory, 
    hardworking, deterministic and optimistic nature added to my technical skill-set
</p>

<p>With my ancestory tree starting from north eastern india and ending in central india.
    I was born and raised in central india, though I quite of often my place of birth of 
    my ancestory, I myself have spent majority part of my life in central india.
</p>

<p>Speaking of my birth, you can surely refer to me as live example of byproduct of marriage 
    between science and arts. As my father holds a doctorate of philosophy in the field of 
    food science and mother holds a doctorate of philosophy in the field of arts.</p>

<p>My thought process is learning-based. I utilize my spare time to perform self-analysis to 
    understand why i did wrong or how i did it right. I am a good listener and so I listen when 
    other people share something and later do an learning analysis of what i can learn from their 
    experience further try and realize value of knowledge shared so in order to determine it's 
    effective implementation.</p>

<p>One's thought process is not just a thought process, it's mirror image of the surronding one 
    is raised in and impression of people who contributed to that surrounding and so on that note, I
    would say I am privleged to always have been surrounded by highly intellectual mind which
    includes my family members, close relative, friends and senior who from the day one made sure 
    that they share with me what was once taught to them by some of their elder because they cared
    about them, and slso for simple reason being that someday i could make contribution of equivalent 
    importance as once they made in my life by sharing that valuable knowledge
</p>

<p>A few good thing people praise about me are my kind-heartedness, time-management, confidence,
    communication skills, hardwork, creativity, determination, oratorial skills and obidience. 
    I know no one is flawless and so neither am I and so certain suggested areas of improvements 
    for me are Mathematics, emotional quotient, and logical reasoning
