<p>Hello There, Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening to you depending on whatever time zone you 
are currently following. I would like to thank you for visiting my portfolio, I hope you finding my 
profile in alignment with your requirements for desired candidates. My attempts behind developing this 
portfolio is introduce you with Who I am, What I did, What Interests me most, and Why you should hire me.</p>

<p>In my attempts to help you get to know me in the best possible way, I made sure that your experience 
is not hindered by device sizes by making this portfolio responsive so feel free to leverage the benefit
of responsive UI by viewing website on any device of your choice as per your comfort level.</p>

<p>Another of my several attempts to ensure comfort level of user while portraying myself in the best 
possible way is to connect my skype account to support video conferencing alongside connecting my
email and other social accounts such as facebook, linkedin, twitter and github to help user understand 
my social outreach which might not seem much of importance to most people but is actually of severe
importance because when the larger social outreach an employee has it is that many number of people
a company's product can reach or atleast has potential to reach alongside connecting my github thus
proving my familiarity and workability knowledge in regards to highly demanded and utilized version
control system.</p>

<p>I won't be discussing much of all of my attempts to portray myself, because that is what you 
visited this website for and further it would reduce value of all my time and efforts to nothing. So I will conclude 
my discussion by encouraging you to explore different parts of the website inorder to get to know me 
better.</p>

<p>Thanking you</p>
