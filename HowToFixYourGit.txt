It took more than two days to figure what i exactly had to do in order to fix
my broken git; you might think how git can break but remember it's no human
and is merely a system that operates on human instructions; git's usefulness
is defined by content it holds and the person who operates it.

I made a mistake and to make sure you don't do the same but if you are anything
like you are highly likely to repeat the mistake and so just to make sure next
time fixing it takes as much time as it actually requires.

Follow simple steps given below:

1) git reset HEAD fileName; to uncommit a file

2) git rm --cached /pathToYourFolderThatIsNotbeingDeleted

3) git status; if the output is green and says deleted followed by folderName

4) after above result is in your favor that is result is green and says deleted
type 
	git add folderName
	git commit -m "your message"
	git push -u origin; to push the file to origin
