Dear Recruiter,
	</p>
<p style="text-align:justified;">
If you are viewing this it means i have got your attention and I have given one of many reasons to <br>hire me.
Now, lets get you a little deep insight about exactly who i am and what makes me different from my 
fellow peers. 
	</p>
	<p>	
I am an honest, hardworking, determined, flexible, quick learner, punctual, reliable, 
self-capable but supervision<br>loving person. I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, looking forward to completing<br>
my masters degree by given timeline (May 2017). During my under-graduation from computer science, 
I was able<br>to grab opportunities to work on two projects for fulfilling my academic requirement and 
one commercial project<br>on a freelance basis. 
</p>
<p>
Since, I am holding no prior industry experience it makes me good candidate to look out for, as 
I can be easily<br>moulded according to organizational requirement. While I am working towards third 
semester in Masters of Science<br>in Computer Science program, I happened to have work on several projects
as a part of academic curriculum.  
</p>
<p>
In the near future I look forward to work for but not limited to the fields like Cloud Computing, 
Networking, Data Science,<br>Internet-of-things, Software and Web Development. I possess a good academic
standing and hence can assure you that<br>on being given a chance, I can prove worth as an asset to organization . 
</p>
	
<p>
Looking forward to hearing back from you
	</p>
Sincerely,<br> 
Harshit Singh
